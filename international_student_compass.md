## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
To create the one app every student needs to make their dream of studying abroad a reality,making the entire process simple, exciting, and less lonely.

The Problem We’re Fixing
Right now, figuring out how to study in another country is a mess. Students have to search dozens of confusing websites, forums, and social media groups. They don’t know who to trust, the information is scattered everywhere, and it feels like you’re doing it all by yourself. It’s stressful and makes people give up.

What We’re Building
We are building one simple place for everything you need:

A Student Community: A friendly place to connect with students from all over the world. You can ask for real, honest advice from people who have already done it, and make friends before you even arrive in your new country.
Easy Search Tools: Find the perfect university and scholarships without the headache. No more opening 50 browser tabs. We’ll put everything you need to know in one clean, easy-to-search list.
Real Tips & Help: A library full of helpful short videos, guides, and advice from current international students. Learn everything from “how to pack” to “how to open a bank account.”

### 2.2 Use Cases and Diagrams
This diagram shows all the major actions (use cases) that each type of user (actor) can perform, giving a complete "bird's-eye view" of the system's capabilities.

### 3.2 Usability
We plan on designing the user interface as intuitive and self-explanatory as possible to make the user feel as comfortable as possible using the webapp. Though an FAQ document will be available, it should not be necessary to use it.

#### 3.2.1 No training time needed
Our goal is that opens the app and is able to use all features without any explanation or help.

#### 3.2.2 Familiar Feeling
Our design philosophy is simple: Don't reinvent the wheel. The app should look and feel like the apps our users already use every day. This will make it feel intuitive from the moment they open it.

### 3.3 Reliability
This section defines the system's ability to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period.

#### 3.3.1 Availability
The application shall have a minimum uptime of 99.5%, measured on a monthly basis. This corresponds to a maximum of 3.65 hours of unplanned downtime per month. Scheduled maintenance windows will be planned during periods of lowest user activity (e.g., 02:00-04:00 CET) and will be announced to users at least 48 hours in advance.

#### Data Integrity and Recovery

The system must ensure zero data loss of critical user-generated content (e.g., profiles, community posts, chat messages) in the event of a non-catastrophic system failure.

Backups: Automated daily backups of the primary database are required.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable data loss in a disaster scenario is 24 hours.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): In the event of a system failure, critical services must be restored within 4 hours.

3.4 Performance
This section specifies the performance characteristics of the software under various workloads.

3.4.1 Response Time
API Performance: Core API endpoints (e.g., user authentication, fetching university data, posting a message) must have a 95th percentile (p95) server-side response time of less than 500ms.

Page Load: Key user-facing pages (Home Dashboard, Search Results Page) must achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

3.4.2 Concurrency
The system must be able to support 500 concurrent users performing standard read-and-write operations (e.g., searching, posting, and chatting) without degradation of the response times specified above.

3.4.3 Scalability
The system's architecture must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate user growth. It should be capable of handling a 50% increase in the user base over a three-month period without requiring significant architectural changes.

### 3.5 Supportability

#### 3.5.1 Coding Standards
We are going to write the code by using all of the most common clean code standards. For example we will name our variables and methods by their functionalities. This will keep the code easy to read by everyone and make further developement much easier.

#### 3.5.2 Testing Strategy
The application will have a high test coverage and all important functionalities and edge cases should be tested. Further mistakes in the implementation will be discovered instantly and it will be easy to locate the error. 

### 3.6 Design Constraints
This section describes the hardware and  architectural  decisions and constraints that guide the development of the application.

### Hardware Accessibility
The system must be built as a Web-based application to ensure accessibility for international students who may not own a smartphone. The architecture must prioritize performance on shared desktop hardware (e.g., library or school computers) and low-bandwidth connections.
We are building the application using a decoupled, three-tier architecture consisting of a frontend client, a backend application server, and a database. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns and enhances scalability.

Frontend Architecture
We have chosen Vue.js as a design constraint for our frontend development. Its component-based structure is ideal for building a maintainable UI. To achieve strong Search Engine Optimization (SEO)—critical for a platform focused on discovery—we will use the Nuxt.js framework for its Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities.

Backend Architecture
A custom backend using Node.js and Express.js is a core architectural constraint. This decision was made to ensure maximum flexibility, control over our business logic, and the ability to optimize performance specifically for our application's needs. Communication between the frontend and backend will be handled via a RESTful API that we will design and build. This approach allows for long-term scalability and avoids vendor lock-in associated with Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms.

Supported Platforms
The application is a web app and must be fully functional on the latest stable versions of modern web browsers:

Google Chrome

Mozilla Firefox

Apple Safari

Microsoft Edge

### 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements
The usage of the app should be as intuitive as possible so it won't need any further documentation. If the user needs some help we will implement a "Help"-Button on the web which includes a FAQ and a formular to contact the developement team.

### 3.8 Purchased Components
We don't have any purchased components yet. If there will be purchased components in the future we will list them here.

### 3.9 Interfaces

#### 3.9.1 User Interfaces

The User Interface is a Responsive Web Application. It must be platform-agnostic, supporting standard input methods (keyboard/mouse) and varying screen resolutions to accommodate legacy desktop hardware.
The User Interfaces that will be implemented are:

Home Dashboard - Acts as a personalized starting point, showing recommended scholarships, trending discussions, and relevant online courses.

University Search Page - Allows users to search for universities by country or name and displays the results in a clear list.

University Profile Page - Shows detailed, community-enriched information about a specific university, including student reviews, photos, and a link to its dedicated discussion space.

Scholarship Search Page - A powerful search tool with detailed filters to help students find relevant funding opportunities.

Online Courses Page - A curated discovery page for finding relevant online courses, with filters for price and skill level.

Chat & Conversation Pages - Includes the main chat inbox listing all conversations, and the individual chat screen for sending and receiving messages.

User Profile Page - Displays a user's public information (e.g., their university, field of study) and their contributions to the community, like their reviews.

Login & Register Pages - Provides the standard forms for user authentication (Sign Up, Log In, Password Reset).

Settings Page - Allows users to manage their account details, notification preferences, and privacy settings.

#### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces
(n/a)

#### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces
The User Interface is a Responsive Web Application. It must be platform-agnostic, supporting standard input methods (keyboard/mouse) and varying screen resolutions to accommodate legacy desktop hardware.

The system shall interface with the University Search API via RESTful endpoints to retrieve scholarship and institutional data. All data exchange between the application and external services will be handled via JSON over HTTPS.

The application is a web app and does not require a specific operating system. The primary software interface for the end-user is a modern web browser. The platform will officially support the latest versions of:

Google Chrome

Mozilla Firefox

Apple Safari

Microsoft Edge

### 3.9.4 Communication Interfaces
The server and hardware will communicate using the http protocol. 

### 3.10 Licensing Requirements
