### 2.4 List

    When I scroll down to the comments section
    Then all comments for this post will be displayed
    And I can see the comment content and author

```

### 2.5 Delete
The user can delete a self written comment. There is a button in the edit view to delete the comment. To ensure the user does not accidentally delete a comment, we added a modal asking for confirmation.

    And the comment is gone
